# MPA-Post-Hoc-Accounting-QGIS-Plugin  ![Plugin Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MACBIO/MPAPostHocAccounting/master/icon.png "Plugin Icon")

This plugin is used to check how a MPA network meets Marine Spatial Planning MPA Placement Objectives. For example, the MPA network should cover 10% of each bioregion and each bioregion should be replicated (intersected) by 3 MPAs.

# Sample data can be found in this repository:
https://github.com/MACBIO/MPAPostHocAccounting-SampleData

1. Download the whole repository as a zip file and then extract the files.
2. Use QGIS to open the file "SampleQGISproject.qgs" to view the sample datasets.
3. Use the plugin to create an output objectives accounting spreadsheet.
4. The file "SampleOutputSpreadsheet.xls" is a pre-generated spreadsheet that should match your newly-created spreadsheet.
